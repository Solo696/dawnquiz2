Examples include Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Proof of Bandwidth." },
  { id:"b36", diff:"beginner", question:"What does 'data sovereignty' mean for internet users?", options:["All user data must be stored in servers physically located in the user's home country","Users have full ownership and control over their own data and who accesses it","Governments have the right to audit any data passing through their national infrastructure","Data can only be processed by companies that hold a recognized data protection license"], correct:1, hint:"Sovereignty means control over something that's yours.", explanation:"Data sovereignty means individuals control their own data — where it's stored, who accesses it, and how it's used. Centralized platforms routinely harvest and monetize user data; decentralized alternatives aim to return that control to users." },
  { id:"b37", diff:"beginner", question:"What does it mean to 'run a node' for a network like Dawn?", options:["Purchase and hold the protocol's native token to support its market valuation","Install and operate software or hardware that contributes resources to the decentralized network","Become a paid contractor responsible for monitoring network uptime and reliability","Submit code contributions to the open-source repository on a regular basis"], correct:1, hint:"Nodes are the physical participants in the network.", explanation:"Running a node means operating hardware or software that actively participates in the Dawn network by contributing bandwidth, relaying traffic, and helping maintain network connectivity — the physical backbone of decentralization." },

This property ensures historical integrity and prevents fraud or record manipulation." },
  { id:"b42", diff:"beginner", question:"What is the difference between a 'token' and a 'coin' in crypto?", options:["Coins have fixed supply; tokens have programmable supply curves controlled by DAOs","Coins operate on their own native blockchain; tokens are built on top of an existing blockchain","Tokens are only used for governance; coins are only used for paying transaction fees","Coins require proof-of-work mining; tokens are always issued via proof-of-stake consensus"], correct:1, hint:"Native vs. built on top of another chain.", explanation:"A coin (like Bitcoin or Ether) is the native currency of its own blockchain. A token is built on an existing blockchain using smart contracts (like ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum) and relies on that chain's infrastructure." },
  { id:"b43", diff:"beginner", question:"Why does the Dawn network get stronger as more nodes join?", options:["More nodes vote in governance decisions, making protocol upgrades faster to approve","Each additional node adds more bandwidth capacity, redundancy, and geographic coverage","More nodes increase token scarcity by consuming rewards faster than they are emitted","Additional nodes improve block finality speed by reducing validator communication overhead"], correct:1, hint:"More contributors = more capacity and resilience.", explanation:"Network effects mean each additional node adds bandwidth, creates routing redundancy, and extends geographic coverage. A larger node network is faster, more resilient, harder to censor, and more valuable to users." },

  { id:"e50", diff:"expert", question:"What is 'cryptographic commitment scheme' and how is it used in trustless bandwidth auctions?", options:["A token lockup mechanism that commits node operators to a minimum service level for a fixed duration","A two-phase protocol where participants commit to a hashed bid then reveal it — preventing manipulation while keeping bids private","A zero-knowledge proof system that proves a bid is within a valid range without revealing the actual amount","A smart contract pattern that escrows funds until both parties confirm that the agreed service was delivered"], correct:1, hint:"Commit first (sealed bid), reveal second — prevents last-minute manipulation.", explanation:"Commitment schemes in bandwidth auctions work as sealed bids: participants submit H(bid, nonce) in the commit phase (hidden but binding), then reveal bid and nonce in the reveal phase. This prevents sniping and manipulation, ensuring fair price discovery in trustless bandwidth markets." },

// BlackBox Challenge questions (10 expert scenarios)
const BLACKBOX_QS = [
  { id:"bb1", diff:"expert", question:"You've just received your BlackBox. Before connecting it, what is the most important first step?", options:["Mine as much bandwidth as possible immediately","Review the network's contribution requirements and ensure your ISP connection meets minimum uptime and bandwidth thresholds","Connect it to the fastest available WiFi","Register on 5 different accounts to maximize rewards"], correct:1, hint:"Infrastructure requires preparation before deployment.", explanation:"Before deploying, verifying that your connection meets the network's SLA requirements ensures you won't be penalized for failing to deliver promised bandwidth — protecting your reputation score." },
  { id:"bb2", diff:"expert", question:"Your BlackBox is running but your contribution score is low. Diagnostics show 40% packet loss. What do you investigate first?", options:["The Dawn app version","Your upstream router's QoS settings and ISP bandwidth contention ratio","The color indicator on the BlackBox","Your Sunray balance"], correct:1, hint:"QoS = Quality of Service. What controls packet prioritization?", explanation:"QoS misconfiguration is the most common cause of packet loss for new deployments. Ensuring the router prioritizes the BlackBox's traffic and checking your ISP's contention ratio resolves most reliability issues." },
  { id:"bb3", diff:"expert", question:"The Dawn network issues a bandwidth challenge to your BlackBox. What does successfully responding to this challenge prove?", options:["That you paid your subscription fee","That your node is genuinely online and delivering real, verifiable bandwidth to the network","That your hardware is new","That you've answered quiz questions correctly"], correct:1, hint:"Challenges exist to verify real contribution, not just presence.", explanation:"Challenge-response protocols cryptographically verify that your node is actively serving real traffic. This prevents reward farming by nodes that claim to be online without actually delivering bandwidth." },
  { id:"bb4", diff:"expert", question:"Another node operator offers to share reward fees if you point your BlackBox to their private routing server instead of the Dawn network. What is this?", options:["A legitimate business partnership","A Sybil/routing attack attempt that undermines network integrity and violates contribution rules","A valid optimization strategy","Standard DePIN practice"], correct:1, hint:"If it routes your contribution away from the main network, what does that do to the network?", explanation:"This is a routing attack — redirecting your node's bandwidth away from the legitimate network to a private server breaks the decentralized trust model and likely violates contribution agreements, risking node banning." },
  { id:"bb5", diff:"expert", question:"Your BlackBox has been running for 30 days with near-perfect uptime. What mechanism rewards this long-term reliability?", options:["One-time signup bonus","Streak multipliers or uptime bonuses that increase your effective reward rate for sustained high-availability contribution","Random lottery rewards","Higher hardware resale value"], correct:1, hint:"Long-term reliable nodes are more valuable to the network than intermittent ones.", explanation:"Uptime streak bonuses incentivize sustained, reliable contribution. Long-running nodes with high availability SLAs are disproportionately valuable to network reliability, so the reward model compensates them accordingly." },
  { id:"bb6", diff:"expert", question:"The Dawn network is under a coordinated DDoS attack targeting active nodes. What should a BlackBox operator do?", options:["Disconnect immediately and wait for instructions","Apply rate limiting, enable flood protection, and check Dawn's official communication channels for network-wide guidance","Ignore it — hardware will handle it","Increase bandwidth contribution to fight back"], correct:1, hint:"Defense-in-depth: local mitigation + staying informed.", explanation:"Rate limiting and flood protection mitigate the immediate impact while staying connected to official channels ensures coordinated response. Isolated disconnection doesn't help the network defend itself." },
  { id:"bb7", diff:"expert", question:"As a BlackBox Holder, why are you considered 'pre-Deployer' rather than already at Deployer level?", options:["BlackBox Holders haven't paid the Deployer fee","The Deployer level requires demonstrated mastery of advanced scenarios and sustained network contribution that goes beyond hardware ownership","BlackBox Holders are on a waiting list","It's an arbitrary distinction"], correct:1, hint:"Ownership of hardware ≠ mastery of the ecosystem.", explanation:"The Deployer rank requires proving expert-level understanding of network economics, attack vectors, and contribution mechanics — not just hardware ownership. This ensures Deployers can responsibly support the network's growth." },
  { id:"bb8", diff:"expert", question:"Two nodes in your area both report 1Gbps bandwidth availability. Node A has been active for 6 months; Node B started yesterday. Which should receive more routing priority and why?", options:["Node B, because fresh nodes are faster","Node A, because its sustained track record provides higher reliability confidence than an unproven new node","Both equally — past performance is irrelevant","Neither — routing is random"], correct:1, hint:"Track record is evidence of reliability. New nodes are unknown quantities.", explanation:"Reputation-weighted routing prioritizes nodes with proven reliability histories. Node A's 6-month track record provides statistical confidence in future performance that Node B simply cannot offer yet." },
  { id:"bb9", diff:"expert", question:"What is the economic significance of the 160 Sunray threshold for BlackBox Holder rank?", options:["It's the cost of purchasing a BlackBox","It represents sufficient demonstrated ecosystem engagement that the network can trust the operator with higher-responsibility deployment roles","It unlocks a special discount","It's an arbitrary game mechanic"], correct:1, hint:"Thresholds signal earned trust and commitment.", explanation:"The 160 Sunray threshold ensures BlackBox Holders have invested significant time learning the ecosystem before taking on deployment responsibilities. It's a trust signal, not just a game mechanic — it filters for genuine participants." },
  { id:"bb10", diff:"expert", question:"A future protocol upgrade changes Dawn's reward distribution formula, reducing payouts for nodes below a minimum bandwidth threshold. How should a responsible BlackBox Holder respond?", options:["Immediately sell the hardware","Review the upgrade rationale, assess whether current setup meets the new threshold, upgrade infrastructure if needed, and participate in governance discussion","Ignore it and hope rewards continue","Create multiple accounts to compensate"], correct:1, hint:"Protocol upgrades require active, engaged participation from operators — not passive reaction.", explanation:"Responsible operators review protocol changes rationally, adapt their infrastructure if needed, and participate in governance. Decentralized networks depend on engaged, thoughtful operators — not passive participants who react only to personal financial impact." },

// Deployer Final Run questions (20 ultra-hard)
const DEPLOYER_QS = [
  { id:"d1",  diff:"expert", question:"In a Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus model, what is the maximum fraction of malicious nodes a network can tolerate while maintaining correctness?", options:["Up to 1/2","Up to 1/3","Up to 2/3","Up to 1/4"], correct:1, hint:"Byzantine Generals Problem — the classical bound.", explanation:"BFT systems can tolerate up to f malicious nodes out of 3f+1 total nodes — meaning less than 1/3 of nodes can be adversarial before consensus breaks down. This is why node distribution and operator diversity matter in Dawn." },
  { id:"d2",  diff:"expert", question:"What cryptographic primitive enables a Dawn node to prove bandwidth delivery without revealing the actual data packets transmitted?", options:["Symmetric encryption","Zero-knowledge proofs combined with commitment schemes","Simple digital signatures","Hash functions alone"], correct:1, hint:"Prove a fact without revealing the underlying data.", explanation:"Zero-knowledge proofs allow nodes to cryptographically demonstrate that they served specific data to specific requesters without exposing the content — preserving user privacy while enabling fraud-proof contribution verification." },
  { id:"d3",  diff:"expert", question:"Why does Dawn's architecture prioritize 'data plane separation' between routing decisions and actual traffic forwarding?", options:["To reduce code complexity","To enable rapid protocol upgrades and attack response without disrupting active traffic flows","To decrease node hardware requirements","To allow centralized monitoring"], correct:1, hint:"Control vs. data plane separation is a core networking design pattern.", explanation:"Separating the control plane (routing decisions, protocol governance) from the data plane (actual traffic) means protocol upgrades and emergency responses can be applied without dropping live connections — critical for production-grade infrastructure." },
  { id:"d4",  diff:"expert", question:"A Deployer is tasked with onboarding 50 new nodes in a new geographic market. What metric is most critical to validate first?", options:["Hardware cost per unit","Upstream ISP peering agreements and local internet exchange point (IXP) availability","Number of potential users","Regulatory environment for crypto assets"], correct:1, hint:"The network is only as good as its upstream connectivity.", explanation:"IXP availability and upstream peering quality determine whether new nodes can efficiently exchange traffic with the broader internet. Without quality upstream connectivity, new nodes create local islands rather than true network expansion." },
  { id:"d5",  diff:"expert", question:"What is 'eclipse attack' in the context of a P2P network like Dawn, and what's the primary defense?", options:["A DDoS attack using solar interference","An attack where a malicious actor surrounds a target node with adversarial peers, isolating it from the honest network; defended by diverse peer selection","An eclipse of bandwidth contribution","A hardware failure during peak hours"], correct:1, hint:"Imagine being surrounded by enemies who control all your information sources.", explanation:"An eclipse attack isolates a node by controlling all its peer connections, feeding it false information about the network state. Randomized peer selection with cryptographic peer ID verification makes it statistically impractical to surround a target." },
  { id:"d6",  diff:"expert", question:"Token inflation through excessive node reward emissions can destabilize a DePIN economy. What mechanism does a well-designed protocol use to counterbalance this?", options:["Simply stop paying rewards","Emission halvings, demand-side token burns tied to bandwidth consumption, and difficulty adjustments that increase with network growth","Print more tokens to compensate","Centralize reward distribution"], correct:1, hint:"Supply-demand balance requires mechanisms on both sides.", explanation:"Sustainable token economies combine decreasing emission curves (halvings/tail decay) with demand-side sinks (burning tokens for bandwidth access) to maintain value. As the network grows, organic demand absorbs new supply — a key Tokenomics design principle." },
  { id:"d7",  diff:"expert", question:"As a Deployer supporting the Dawn network, what is your primary responsibility beyond just running hardware?", options:["Marketing the protocol on social media","Actively contributing to network health through uptime reliability, participation in governance, and helping onboard new operators","Holding as many Sunrays as possible","Competing against other Deployers for dominance"], correct:1, hint:"A Deployer is a network steward, not just a hardware operator.", explanation:"Deployers are infrastructure stewards — their responsibility extends to reliable uptime, governance participation, and ecosystem growth. The network's credibility depends on its most advanced operators behaving as committed long-term participants." },
  { id:"d8",  diff:"expert", question:"What is 'routing table poisoning' and why is it particularly dangerous in a decentralized bandwidth network?", options:["A database corruption error","Injection of false routing information that misdirects traffic, causing nodes to waste bandwidth on invalid routes or enabling man-in-the-middle attacks","A protocol for faster routing","A consensus mechanism flaw"], correct:1, hint:"False routing info = traffic goes to the wrong place or the attacker.", explanation:"Routing table poisoning corrupts the distributed routing map, sending traffic through malicious nodes or black holes. In a bandwidth network, this causes node penalties, user service degradation, and potential data interception — far worse than in traditional networks." },
  { id:"d9",  diff:"expert", question:"What does 'slashing' mean in a proof-of-stake-adjacent node accountability system?", options:["Reducing hardware performance","Automatically destroying a portion of a node operator's staked tokens as punishment for provable misbehavior or downtime violations","Increasing reward rates","A network speed boost mechanism"], correct:1, hint:"It's the stick that makes the carrot (staking) meaningful.", explanation:"Slashing creates economic accountability — operators who violate SLAs or behave maliciously lose a portion of their stake. This aligns node operator incentives with network health: the cost of misbehavior outweighs potential gains." },
  { id:"d10", diff:"expert", question:"Dawn's long-term vision involves displacing significant market share from centralized ISPs. What is the single most critical adoption barrier to overcome?", options:["Hardware is too expensive","Last-mile quality-of-service parity — decentralized bandwidth must match or exceed centralized ISP reliability and latency to achieve mainstream adoption","Marketing budget","Number of token holders"], correct:1, hint:"Users won't switch unless the alternative is at least as good.", explanation:"Quality-of-service parity is the ultimate adoption barrier. End users and enterprises will only migrate from familiar ISP relationships to decentralized alternatives when reliability, latency, and support match existing expectations — technical excellence must precede market share." },
  { id:"d11", diff:"expert", question:"A governance proposal suggests increasing the BlackBox minimum bandwidth requirement from 100Mbps to 250Mbps. What is the primary trade-off?", options:["No significant trade-off","Higher minimum improves network quality but reduces accessibility for operators in emerging markets with limited connectivity options","Higher minimum reduces rewards for all","Lower minimum is always better"], correct:1, hint:"Quality vs. accessibility — the eternal infrastructure tension.", explanation:"Raising minimum requirements improves the average network quality and user experience, but excludes operators in regions where 250Mbps isn't accessible or affordable. Governance must balance network performance goals with global accessibility — a core tension in decentralized infrastructure." },
  { id:"d12", diff:"expert", question:"What is 'economic abstraction' in the context of DePIN reward systems, and why do some protocols avoid it?", options:["Using fiat currency instead of tokens","Allowing users to pay for bandwidth in any token, abstracting away the native token requirement; avoided because it can reduce native token demand and destabilize tokenomics","A form of token burning","A routing optimization technique"], correct:1, hint:"If you don't need the native token, why hold it?", explanation:"Economic abstraction lets users transact in any asset, removing mandatory native token utility. While user-friendly, it severs the link between network demand and token value — potentially making the token purely speculative rather than functionally necessary." },
  { id:"d13", diff:"expert", question:"When evaluating a DePIN protocol's long-term viability per the Messari DePIN 2025 framework, which factor is weighted most heavily?", options:["Total token market cap","Ratio of organic demand (real users paying for services) to reward-driven supply (nodes running only for tokens)","Number of Twitter followers","Speed of the founding team's previous exits"], correct:1, hint:"Organic demand = real-world utility. Without it, it's all speculation.", explanation:"The organic demand ratio is the critical long-term viability signal. Networks where real users pay for real services are self-sustaining; networks where nodes run purely for token rewards are vulnerable to death spirals when token prices fall." },
  { id:"d14", diff:"expert", question:"What is the purpose of a 'watchtower' node in advanced decentralized network architectures?", options:["A node with the tallest physical location","An independent monitoring node that detects and reports misbehavior by other nodes without requiring those nodes to self-report","A node reserved for the founding team","A performance monitoring dashboard"], correct:1, hint:"External oversight is more reliable than self-reporting.", explanation:"Watchtower nodes independently monitor network participants and cryptographically attest to misbehavior, enabling slashing without requiring victims to report attacks themselves. They're a trustless accountability layer." },
  { id:"d15", diff:"expert", question:"A large enterprise wants to use Dawn for last-mile connectivity for a remote workforce. What technical requirement is non-negotiable for enterprise SLA compliance?", options:["Custom branding on the BlackBox","Deterministic failover to redundant nodes with sub-second recovery time and cryptographically verifiable uptime SLA attestation","Lowest possible cost per gigabyte","Support for a specific operating system"], correct:1, hint:"Enterprises need guaranteed uptime with proof — not just best-effort.", explanation:"Enterprise SLAs require guaranteed failover behavior and cryptographic uptime proofs that can be audited. Without deterministic redundancy and verifiable attestation, enterprises cannot fulfill their own downstream service obligations." },
  { id:"d16", diff:"expert", question:"How does content-addressed storage differ from location-addressed storage, and why is it relevant to decentralized internet?", options:["Content-addressed is faster","Content is identified by what it IS (its hash) rather than where it lives, enabling any node to serve it and eliminating single-location dependencies","They are functionally equivalent","Content-addressed requires centralized indexing"], correct:1, hint:"Address the data by its fingerprint, not its location.", explanation:"Content addressing (e.g., IPFS CIDs) allows any node holding a piece of data to serve it, because requests specify what data is needed (its hash) not where it lives. This eliminates single-origin dependencies and enables true decentralization of content delivery." },
  { id:"d17", diff:"expert", question:"What systemic risk does excessive Deployer concentration in a single jurisdiction create for the Dawn network?", options:["Higher average latency worldwide","Regulatory capture — a single government can compel network disruption by threatening Deployers in its jurisdiction, undermining global censorship resistance","Lower token value","Reduced hardware compatibility"], correct:1, hint:"Geographic diversity is as important as technical diversity.", explanation:"Deployer concentration in one jurisdiction creates regulatory capture risk — a single government can effectively shut down or control a significant portion of the network. True censorship resistance requires Deployers distributed across multiple regulatory environments." },
  { id:"d18", diff:"expert", question:"In Dawn's contribution model, what distinguishes a 'cold node' from a 'warm node'?", options:["Temperature of the hardware","A cold node is dormant/offline or contributing below minimum viable thresholds; a warm node is active, routing real traffic, and accumulating reputation","Cold nodes mine tokens, warm nodes route traffic","Hardware age"], correct:1, hint:"Hot/warm/cold = activity and availability level.", explanation:"Warm nodes are actively serving traffic and building reputation score. Cold nodes are offline or below threshold — they don't contribute to network health and don't earn meaningful rewards. The distinction matters for understanding true network capacity." },
  { id:"d19", diff:"expert", question:"Why is verifiable random function (VRF) important for fair node selection in decentralized networks?", options:["It speeds up the network","VRF provides cryptographically provable randomness that cannot be manipulated by any party, ensuring node selection for tasks is unpredictable and bias-free","It reduces bandwidth requirements","It simplifies smart contract logic"], correct:1, hint:"Unbiased, unpredictable, and provably fair selection.", explanation:"VRF-based selection ensures that no single actor can predict or manipulate which node is selected for a task. This prevents targeted Sybil attacks on selection and ensures fair reward distribution proportional to honest contribution." },
  { id:"d20", diff:"expert", question:"You are now a Deployer. What does your continued participation in the Dawn network represent beyond personal reward?", options:["A personal financial investment only","Stewardship of decentralized infrastructure — your node is part of the foundation that makes censorship-resistant internet access possible for users worldwide","A competitive advantage over other nodes","A commitment to holding Sunrays"], correct:1, hint:"The final question: why does any of this matter?", explanation:"Deployers are the backbone of a genuinely decentralized internet. Every node you run strengthens the network's resistance to censorship, corporate capture, and single points of failure — contributing to a more open internet for everyone, not just token holders." },

Generate exactly ${n} ${diff}-level multiple-choice questions. Each question must be unique, factually accurate, and directly relevant to Dawn Internet, decentralized infrastructure (DePIN), blockchain technology, DeFi, or Web3 concepts.

Difficulty guidance:
- beginner: foundational concepts, terminology, basic mechanics — no prior knowledge required
- intermediate: node operations, tokenomics, DeFi mechanics, Layer 2s, real-world protocol behaviour
- expert: advanced attack vectors, cryptoeconomic security, protocol design trade-offs, zero-knowledge proofs, Byzantine fault tolerance

Return ONLY a valid JSON array with no markdown, no preamble, no trailing text. Each object must have exactly these fields:
{
  "id": "ai_${diff}_TIMESTAMP_INDEX",
  "diff": "${diff}",
  "question": "...",
  "options": ["option A", "option B", "option C", "option D"],
  "correct": 0,
  "hint": "...",
  "explanation": "..."
}

Rules:
- "correct" is the 0-based index of the correct option in the "options" array
- CRITICAL: All 4 options must be similar in length and specificity. Wrong answers must be as detailed and plausible as the correct answer — never short throwaway phrases. A player should not be able to guess the correct answer by picking the longest or most detailed option.
- Hint must not give away the answer directly
- Explanation must be 1-3 sentences, educational, and accurate
- Do not repeat questions already covered by basic definitions — go deeper`;

    context: `DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) represents protocols that incentivize communities to build real-world infrastructure using blockchain rewards. Dawn is classified under connectivity/wireless infrastructure — protocols that decentralize internet access and bandwidth provision. Key themes: organic demand ratio as viability signal, geographic diversity of nodes, Sybil resistance, proof-of-bandwidth mechanisms, token emission sustainability, and the cold start problem for new node operators. Messari weights organic demand (real users paying for services) over reward-driven supply as the critical long-term viability metric.`
  },
  2: {
    title: "Blockmates Infrastructure Deep Dive",
    context: `Dawn's infrastructure layer differentiates itself through community-owned bandwidth contribution rather than corporate data centers. Key architectural concepts: node reputation systems, geographic load balancing, peer discovery optimization, data plane separation from control plane, watchtower nodes for independent monitoring, and challenge-response bandwidth verification protocols.`

  4: {
    title: "The BlackBox — Introduction",
    context: `The BlackBox is Dawn's dedicated hardware node device engineered for optimal bandwidth contribution. Key concepts: minimum bandwidth requirements (100Mbps+), uptime SLA compliance, QoS router configuration, challenge-response verification, routing attack prevention, streak/uptime bonuses, the 160 Sunray threshold for BlackBox Holder rank, and the distinction between cold nodes (dormant) and warm nodes (actively routing traffic).`
  },
  5: {
    title: "A New Dawn for the Internet",
    context: `Dawn's foundational vision: decentralized internet removes single points of censorship and control that centralized ISPs represent. Core principles: permissionless participation, bandwidth contribution model, censorship resistance, no single entity controlling access, community ownership of infrastructure. Decentralization distributes control across many independent nodes rather than corporate servers. The network's strength comes from geographic and operator diversity.`
